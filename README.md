# Harnessing Irregularly Spaced Time-varying Covariates Data for Clinical Prediction

## Abstract
Simulation hands-on using irregularly spaced time-varying data, which is often faced in Electrical Health Records (EHR) data. 
The portfolio validates whether to adjust individual visit (observed) intensity would improve estimator with increased sample size. 
The result is yes, and a few misspecification in visit intensity model can be harmless.
